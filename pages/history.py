## The Genesis 🌄
Jaipur, with its intricate tapestry of history, was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, a visionary ruler of the Kachwaha Rajput dynasty. 🤴 Driven by a profound desire to establish a new capital, he meticulously planned the city's layout based on ancient Vedic principles of architecture and town planning.
