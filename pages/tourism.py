    ###Amber Palace


    The history of Amber Fort Jaipur is truly captivating, dating all the way back to 967 CE. It was Alan Sign, the ruler of the Chanda clan of Meenas, who first constructed the fort and established a settlement called Amer. 

    However, it wasn't until 1592 that Raja Man Singh of the Kachwaha clan, known as one of Emperor Akbar's nine jewels (Navratna), rebuilt Amer ka Kila on top of the original structure. Throughout the reigns of various Rajput rulers, continuous renovations were made to this magnificent fort.
    The final additions and construction of Amer Palace were completed by Sawai Jai Singh, who was a descendant of Raja Man Singh." 
    Interestingly enough, Amber Fort is also referred to as Amber Palace due to its previous name: Ambikeshwar - named after Amba Mata Temple situated atop a hill in the capital city previously known as Dhundhar. Over time, however, this name got shortened from Ambikeshwar to Amber and eventually became Amerâ€”marking its present-day identity within Indian history.
