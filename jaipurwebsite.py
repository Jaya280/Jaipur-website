    The final additions and construction of Amer Palace were completed by Sawai Jai Singh, who was a descendant of Raja Man Singh." 
    Interestingly enough, Amber Fort is also referred to as Amber Palace due to its previous name: Ambikeshwar - named after Amba Mata Temple situated atop a hill in the capital city previously known as Dhundhar.

## The Genesis üåÑ
Jaipur, with its intricate tapestry of history, was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, a visionary ruler of the Kachwaha Rajput dynasty. ü§¥ Driven by a profound desire to establish a new capital, he meticulously planned the city's layout based on ancient Vedic principles of architecture and town planning. The result? A meticulously structured city adorned with pink-hued buildings, earning it the moniker "Pink City." üíñ

### The Visionary Maharaja üëë
Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, often hailed as the architect of modern Jaipur, envisioned a city that would not only serve as a political and economic center but also reflect the splendor and magnificence of Rajputana architecture. His foresight and ingenuity laid the foundation for Jaipur's illustrious legacy, a legacy that continues to thrive centuries later. üè∞

### Vedic Principles in Architecture üèõ
Drawing inspiration from ancient Vedic texts such as the Shilpa Shastra, Maharaja Jai Singh II incorporated sacred geometrical principles and astronomical calculations into the city's design.
